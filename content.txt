1. Class and Objects

2. Class has data/attribute and it has functions/ methods

3. Why Python is called OOP?
    -> Everything in Python is an object (data structuresm data type, etc.)

4. Advantages of OOPS: 
    -> We can create our own DataType
    -> Code reusability
    -> Easy to colab
    -> debug

5. Chatbook class end to end project done. 
    -> We can also create attribute outside the class

    -> Encapsulation
        • Hiding or keeping some attributed private
        • if we want to access : 
                        obj._classname__attributename, when accessing from inside. else if inside the class, we use self.__name

    -> Getter and setter 
        • get and set the hidden attribute
    
    -> Static Method
        • 


    -> Inheritence
